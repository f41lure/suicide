# suicide
CLI program to get frame from user webcam after a specific amount of time has elapsed, add text, and upload it to their desired social media platforms.

###Why would I want to use this?
Say you killed yourself. You could set yourself up in front of your webcam, run this, and have it send a photo of your (dead) self with some edgy bottom text to scare your fellow danklords.
###Why did you make this?
The idea randomly popped into my head and I was bored.
###Should I use this?
No.
